As an AI language model, I don't have access to the latest medical records or diagnostic information. However, there have been several significant advancements in medical diagnosis and technology in the past few years.

Some examples of recent diagnostic advancements include:

Liquid biopsy: a non-invasive diagnostic tool that analyzes cancer cells and fragments in blood samples.

Genomic sequencing: advances in DNA sequencing technology have enabled physicians to identify genetic mutations that can lead to disease.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning: medical imaging technology has advanced significantly in recent years, with the use of AI and machine learning to help diagnose and treat conditions like cancer.

Wearable technology: devices such as smartwatches can monitor various health parameters, allowing for early detection of diseases and conditions.
